## Features ##
The main feature of the app is the real time poll and real time text review. So, when you select a course you have taken. You have to go through some verification process that you have actually taken that course.Then, you rate the course based on difficulty , workload , exams , grading and professor. Then if you want to contribute more , you can type a personalized text feedback. For now, you have to select a course and it redirects you to a new page. The ultimate aim is make a news feed of all the course reviews with the polls where you can scroll and see review overviews of different courses.
